		<h2>Wired Mice</h2>
				
		<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/lasalle/images/2_2.1.png" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A <b>wired mouse</b> connects directly to your computer, usually through a USB port (see bottom figure), 
			and transmits information via the attached cord. Note the cord at the top of the figure above. The 
			cord connection can sometimes provide advantages versus a cordless mouse. For starters, wired mice 
			can provide faster response times, with data transmitted directly through the cable. They also 
			tend to be more accurate than other designs.</p>
				
		<h2>Wireless Mice</h2>
		
		<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/lasalle/images/2_2.2.png" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
	
		<p><b>Wireless mice</b> transmit signals to a receiver that is connected to your computer via a USB port.
			The computer receives the signals and interprets how the cursor was moved or which buttons on the 
			mouse were clicked. Wireless mice provide easier movement and a larger range to use the mouse, however 
			there are some drawbacks. Wireless mice are generally not as responsive to certain gestures as are 
			wired mice. For most users, however, the lag or loss of accuracy with a wireless mouse will not be an 
			issue.</p>
				
		<h2>How to Connect a Mouse</h2>
	
		<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/lasalle/images/2_2.3.png" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
	
		<p>Whether youâ€™re using a wired or wireless mouse, connecting the mouse to your computer is very similar. 
			For a wired mouse, take the wire and find the end plug.  Locate the <b></b>USB Port</b> in the back of the 
			computer or on your laptop (see figure above).  Plug the wire into the port and your mouse will start 
			working.  For a wireless mouse, take the receiver and plug it into the same USB port found on your 
			computer.</p>
