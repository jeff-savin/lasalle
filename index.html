<b>Partner organization:</b> The Centro de Formación Integral LaSalle, A.C. de Tijuana, B. C. It is a
volunteer-run, community school that offers free social and educational programs to low-income communities.</br>

<b>Partner organization’s needs and challenges:</b> The school is currently unable to provide sufficient
digital literacy skills classes to all students due to the lack of digital literacy volunteer teachers and
the lack of digital literacy materials and a teacher training program for the few interested volunteers
without teaching experience. As a result, many students are unable to enroll in digital literacy classes
and are placed in a long wait list.</br>

<b>Specific needs the C4G team will address:</b> The team will provide a bilingual (English/Spanish) digital
literacy skills teacher training program. This program will consist of a six-module digital literacy course,
a self-guided manual on how to use the digital literacy course in the classroom, and a best practice guide on
how to run a digital literacy skills class. This training program will have an off-line and web-based option.</br>

What the solution would look like to the intended users? The web-based solution will consist of a six-module
digital literacy course. Each module will have its own card along with different sections. The sections represent
the actual topics of the module.</br>

In terms of functionality, the website will potentially be responsive, meaning that it will work on any screen
size. This avoids the need to create a separate mobile application. In addition, the website will have a teacher
section where anyone interested in teaching a digital literacy course at the center will get access to the
self-guided manual and the best practices guide.</br> 

Lastly, the teacher training program will have its off-line version. This off-line version will consist of 
pdf files for the digital literacy course, self-guided manual, and best practices guide. </br>

<b>Feedback from partner organization and other stakeholders:</b> We plan to elicit feedback from Jorge,
the center’s director, and from Shivam at our weekly meetings. In addition, one volunteer teacher expressed
interest in providing suggestions and feedback on our project. We plan to gather the teacher’s feedback on a
weekly basis via zoom or via a survey. All feedback will be discussed amongst the team and will be integrated
based on the level of difficulty and time required. </br>

As the project evolves, we will continue to gather feedback from Jorge, Shivam, and current volunteer teachers
via a survey.</br>

<b>Plan for development, evaluation, and deployment: </b> The C4G team formulated the project in five main
phases: research, recruitment, content creation, teacher preparation, and web portal creation and deployment.
We will first research several example classes for digital literacy, incorporating the best ideas for the center.
In the recruitment phase, we will identify teachers interested in teaching the program. 
We will then develop several modules for teaching digital literacy.  Our current plan includes
8 modules covering, for example, introductions to the computer, internet and email.  We will then work with the
recruited faculty to develop teaching guides and best practices.  Finally, the modules will be published online.
