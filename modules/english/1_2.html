		<h2>A desktop computer and its main parts</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/desktop-main-parts.PNG" alt="Alt text" /></p>
				
		<p>A <b>desktop computer</b> (see <b>figure 1</b>) is a computing device designed to fit on top of an office desk due to its size and power 
		requirements. Its main parts consist of a system unit, a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse [1, 3].</p>
				
		
		<h2>The system unit</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/system-unit.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>computer system unit</b> (see <b>figure 2</b>) is a boxlike case that houses additional components of the computer, including the motherboard, 
		central processing unit (CPU), power supply, hard disk drive, and optical disc drive [4, 5]. Other names for the system unit include the 
		computer chassis, cabinet, box, tower, or simply case. Most people erroneously refer to the system unit as the CPU. </p>
		
		<h2>The computer monitor</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/computer-monitor.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>computer monitor</b> (see <b>figure 3</b>) is an output device which displays information in pictorial form (images and text). It comprises of circuitry, 
		a screen, a power supply, buttons to adjust screen settings, and casing that holds all these components [6, 7]. </p>
		
		<h2>The computer keyboard</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/computer-keyboard.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>computer keyboard</b> (see <b>figure 4</b>) is an input device that is used to enter characters (e.g. letters, numbers and other symbols) into a computer system by 
		pressing different buttons or keys [5, 8]. There are different types of keyboards (e.g., wired, wireless, mechanical, membrane, QWERTY, DVORAK, etc.), but most 
		allow you to achieve the same basic tasks [9]. </p>
		
		<h2>The computer mouse</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/computer-mouse.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>computer mouse</b> (see <b>figure 5</b>) is an input device that controls a cursor on the computer screen to interact with files, folders, windows, and other software 
		elements [10]. There are two main mouse types: optical and mechanical [5]. </p>
		
		<h2>A laptop and its main parts</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/laptop_1.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>A <b>laptop</b> is a battery-powered computer that is portable and just about as powerful as a desktop computer [1]. Despite looking different, 
		the laptop and the desktop computer use the same programs and perform similar tasks (see <b>figure 6</b>) [11].</p>
		
		<h2>The webcam</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/webcam.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>A <b>webcam</b> is a type of input device that can record videos and take pictures. It can also transmit video over the Internet in real time, 
		which allows for video chat or video conferencing with someone else [12]. Laptops have a webcam above its screen (see <b>figure 7</b>) [13]. </p>
		
		<h2>The display (or screen)</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/display.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>display (or screen)</b>, like a desktop monitor, is an output device which displays information in pictorial form (images and text). It is built 
		into the laptop’s lid (see <b>figure 8</b>) [14]. </p>

		<h2>The keyboard</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/keyboard.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>keyboard</b> is an input device that is used to enter characters (e.g., letters, numbers, and other symbols) into a laptop by pressing buttons 
		or keys [5]. It is located beneath the laptop’s display, and unlike they keyboard on desktop computers, most laptop keyboards do not have a numeric 
		keypad (see <b>figure 9</b>) [15]. </p>
		
		<h2>The touchpad</h2>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/touchpad.PNG" alt="Alt text"/></p>
				
		<p>The <b>touchpad</b> also called a trackpad is an input device that does the same thigs as a computer mouse [16]. It is a touch-sensitive pad that 
		lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger (see <b>figure 10</b>) [17]. </p>
