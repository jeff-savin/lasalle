		<h2>Module 3: Summary</h2>
				
		<p>In this module, we have learned more about the computer keyboard and its various keys.  The keyboard is a piece of hardware called a peripheral and inputs text and other information into the computer.  We have learned about the six types of keys on the keyboard and spent additional time looking at the alphanumeric keys especially.</p>
		<p>Similar to the computer mouse, the keyboard comes in both wired and wireless versions that can be attached to the computer through the USB port.  We have learned the proper way to begin using the computer keyboard including identifying the home row keys.  Finally, we have learned some important functional keys, including the control, alternate, shift and backspace keys.</p>
