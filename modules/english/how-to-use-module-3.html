<p><strong>Note to the teacher</strong>: This self-guided manual provides some ideas on how to present the content for each of the lessons in module 3. It is by no means the only way to present the content to students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 1: The Computer Keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to will be able to define a computer keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher</strong>: A helpful exercise for this lesson is to instruct students to place both of their hands on the computer keyboard. It is ok if they place their fingers on the incorrect keys for now. Let them press on any of the keys. As they do this, ask them if they notice anything different about the keys (i.e., location, size, feel, etc.). In addition to pressing on each of the keys, ask them to take some time look at the keyboard and check the names, numbers, and characters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 2: Areas of the Keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate between a wired and a wireless computer keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>In this lesson, place emphasis on the alphanumerical and numerical keys. Tell students the differences between them and, if possible, have them press all these keys on a MS Word document. It is helpful to have several keyboard exercises for this lesson and future lessons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 3: Wired and Wireless Keyboards</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate between a wired and a wireless computer keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>It can be very helpful to bring a wired and a wireless keyboard to class. Pass them around for students to take a closer look. This will help students see the main difference between these two. </p>
<p>&nbsp;As the keyboard gets passed around, point out some of its main keys such as the enter key, the spacebar, and the shift key.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 4: Connecting a Keyboard to a Computer</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be able to connect a wired and a wireless computer keyboard to a desktop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>For this lesson, place emphasis on the USB port and the USB receiver. If possible, demonstrate how to connect a wired and wireless keyboard to a desktop computer and to a laptop.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 5: Identify the Home Row</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be able to recognize the home row of the computer keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>It is advisable to place emphasis on keyboard exercises for this lesson. Focus on more exercises than on the theory. If possible, take the time to show each student how to place their hands on the keyboard (after showing a video on how to do this on the class projector).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 6: Important Keys</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of basic computer keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>Just like in the previous lesson, it is very helpful to have several keyboard exercises ready for students. The important keys are usually covered in most keyboard exercises. As students perform these exercises, walk around the classroom and check that students have both of their hands placed on the keyboard correctly. For those who do not have the correct position, remind them how to do so.</p>
