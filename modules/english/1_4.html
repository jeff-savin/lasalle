		<h4>The Different Types of Computer Ports</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.1.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>Each computer is different, so the ports will vary from computer to computer. However, there are certain ones you can expect to find 
		on most desktop computers and laptops. Learning how these ports are used will help whenever you need to connect peripherals to your 
		computer, like a new printer, keyboard, or mouse (see Figure 17) [12].</p>
				
		<h4>The Universal Serial Bus (USB) Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.2.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A USB port is a standard cable connection interface for computers and consumer electronics devices. USB ports can be used to connect 
		almost any type of device, including mice, keyboards, printers, and digital cameras and to transfer digital data over USB cables. They 
		can also supply electric power across the cable to devices that need it [20].</p>
		
		<p>USB 3.1, also known as SuperSpeed+, is the latest version of the USB protocol. It is capable of transfer rates of up to 10 gigabits 
		per second (Gbps), putting it in line with the first generation of Apple's Thunderbolt channel. USB 2.0, also known as hi-speed USB, 
		can support a transfer rate of up to 480 megabits per second (Mbps) [12, 21]. </p>
		
		<p>Most desktop computers have two to four ports in the front and two to eight ports in the back of the system unit. A laptop computer 
		has between one and four ports on the left, right, or both sides of the laptop (see Figure 18) [21].</p>
		
		<h4>The USB Type-C Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.3.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>USB Type-C is a new port for delivering data and power to and from computing devices. Because the USB-C port is symmetrical, a USB-C 
		plug can be inserted either way, eliminating the frustrations of earlier USB ports and putting it on a par with Apple’s reversible 
		Lightning plug (see Figure 19) [22]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Headset Port (or Jack)</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.4.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A headset port (or jack) is used to easily connect speakers, microphones, and headsets without fumbling with the back of the computer 
		[12]. Most desktop computers include in front of the system unit while laptops have it on the left or right side or on the front (see 
		Figure 20) [12]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Power Cable Socket (or Connector)</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.5.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A power cable socket (or connector) is where you connect the power cord to the computer [12]. With the power cord in place, it can 
		then be connected to a power outlet to provide power to the computer (see Figure 21) [23]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Ethernet Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.6.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The ethernet port is used to connect computers, servers, video game consoles, and other devices to the internet. It is typically 
		located on the back of both computers and network devices and is used to establish a wired, as opposed to wireless, internet connection 
		(see Figure 22) [24]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Display Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.7.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>DisplayPort is a digital audio and video interface designed to deliver video and audio over a singular cable [25]. The port comes in 
		two varieties: standard and the smaller Mini DisplayPort. Despite the difference in size, both ports transmit identical signals (see 
		Figure 23) [26].</p>
		
		<h4>The HDMI Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.8.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) ports send audio, video and control information to computers, televisions, projectors, 
		and audio/video receivers. Many computer monitors use this port along with an HDMI cable to transmit digital video and audio signals
		between the system unit and the monitor (see Figure 24) [27]. </p>
		
		<h4>The DVI Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.9.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>DVI (Digital Visual Interface) is a common connection option used for connecting PCs to monitors. It is a standard for transferring 
		video signals from DVI-equipped source devices (like PCs and DVD players) to a video display that also has a DVI video input connection 
		(see Figure 25) [28].</p>
		
		<p>Before HDMI was made available for home theater applications, DVI connections were used for transferring digital video signals from 
		some source devices [28]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Serial Port</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.10.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A serial port is a serial communication physical interface through which information transfers, either in or out, one bit at a time 
		(see Figure 26) [29]. Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data was transferred through serial ports to devices such as 
		modems, terminals, and various peripherals [29].</p>
		
		<h4>The PS/2 Ports</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.11.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The PS/2 (Personal System/2) port, also referred to as the mouse port or keyboard port, was developed by IBM. It is used to connect a 
		computer mouse or keyboard to an IBM compatible computer. The PS/2 port is a mini-DIN plug containing six pins and is still sometimes 
		found on all IBM compatible computers. (see Figure 27) [30]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Different Types of Computer Slots</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.12.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>Computer slots are physical connections that allow the hardware of a computer to be expanded. In other words, computer slots enable 
		users to upgrade their computers (see Figure 28) [31,32].</p>
		
		<h4>The SD Card Slot</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.13.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>An SD card slot is a slot that is used to insert a secure digital memory card into a computer, printer, or other device 
		(see Figure 29) [33]. </p>
		
		<h4>The Expansion Card Slots</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_4.14.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>An expansion card slot is a connection inside a computer on the motherboard or riser card. It provides an installation point for a 
		hardware expansion card to be installed. For example, if your computer did not come with a video card, you could purchase one and install 
		it here (see Figure 30) [12,34]. </p>
