		<h4>Areas of the Keyboard</h4>

		<p>There are six different types of keys on the keyboard and they are color coded above.  The most commonly 
			used are the alphanumeric keys which are in blue.  This is where you’ll find numbers, letters, anything 
			you would commonly use for typing.</p>
		
		<p>In addition to having number keys above the letters in the alphanumeric section, some keyboards will 
			also have a section of only numeric keys as shown in green.  This is common with computer keyboards, 
			but often laptops do not have this keypad to save space.</p>
		
		<p>In purple are the arrow keys  which are commonly used for navigation.  If you’re typing and need to 
			change a letter that’s a few places back from where your cursor is now, use the arrow keys to navigate 
			over there.
		</p>
		
		<p>Other important keys are the system keys which are shown in orange.  These are intermixed around the 
			alphanumeric keys.  These keys are typically used for more advanced functions, such as using keyboard 
			shortcuts to navigate around the computer faster.</p>
		
		<p>The remaining two sections are advanced keyboard use.  These are the pink function keys and the 
			yellow editing keys.  For now, focus on learning about the other four sections.  The only important 
			thing to know about these sections is that if your cursor ever changes and behaves strangely, it’s 
			most likely because you hit the insert key by accident.  Press it again and see if that fixes it.</p>
