<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this module:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to define a computer mouse.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to identify the different areas of a computer mouse.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate between a wired and a wireless computer mouse.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to connect a wired and a wireless computer mouse to a desktop computer.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate the different mouse pointer shapes and the functions they represent.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of and appropriate use of computer mouse clicks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher</strong>: This self-guided manual provides some ideas on how to present the content for each of the lessons in module 2. It is by no means the only way to present the content to students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to define a computer mouse.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to identify the different areas of a computer mouse.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher</strong>: A helpful exercise for this lesson is to instruct students to place their right hand on top of the computer mouse. Let them feel it and encourage them to move it around: to the left, to the right, up and down, lift it and place it back on the desk gently, etc.</p>
<p>This exercise will help them feel more comfortable with this device. Most students who have never used a computer before have an innate fear using a computer due to a previous bad experience or due to having a former teacher who lacked the patience to teach them correctly.</p>
<p>As part of this lesson, please show students a few videos on how to properly use a computer mouse. Ask them to place their right hand on the computer mouse correctly: palm of the hand on the body of the mouse, the index finger on the left button, and the middle finger on the right button. Remind them to use the mouse scroll wheel with their index finger.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 2: Wired and Wireless Mice</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate between a wired and a wireless computer mouse.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to connect a wired and a wireless computer mouse to a desktop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>a good exercise for this lesson is to bring a wired and a wireless computer mouse to the classroom. Pass them around the class for each student to take a closer look at them. As the mice are passed around, ask the students what differences they see between the two.</p>
<p>Most computer is the class will have a wired mouse already. Show students how these mice are connected to the computer, placing emphasis on the USB port. Lastly, please have several computer mouse exercises ready for each student to perform and ask you questions as needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 3: Using the Computer Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to differentiate the different mouse pointer shapes and the functions they represent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of and appropriate use of computer mouse clicks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>For this lesson, it can be very helpful to have a handout with a summary of all the mouse pointers and their functions. This is where having several computer mouse exercises will greatly help.</p>
