<h2>Lesson 1: What is a Computer?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to define a computer.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to define hardware and software.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher</strong>: Before introducing the definition of a computer to students, it can be helpful for the volunteer teacher to get a sense of how many students have heard, seen, and used computers before. The teacher could ask questions such as &ldquo;how many of you have used a computer before?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what do you think a computer is?&rdquo;, &ldquo;can you tell me more about your experience with computers?&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>The goal of these or similar questions is for the teacher to learn more about the student&rsquo;s experience with computers. The answers from students may range from &ldquo;I have used computers before&rdquo; to &ldquo;I have no idea what a computer is&rdquo;. Some students may express that they have seen and heard about computers before but were afraid of them for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>After learning more about the student&rsquo;s experience with computers, the volunteer teacher can then let students know that one of the goals of today&rsquo;s lesson is for everyone to feel comfortable around computers and answer any questions they may have about them.</p>
<p>A helpful exercise that the teacher can do before presenting the concept of the computer is to have each student place their right hand on top of the computer mouse, let them move it around, click on each of the buttons, etc. This exercise can help some students ease their fear about computers and allow them to see that they are in control of the computer, not the other way around. This same exercise can be done with the computer keyboard.</p>
<p>In addition to these exercises, it can also be helpful to have cut outs for each main part of the desktop computer to share with each student. This can help the student have a visual representation of each part to take home and/or to review later. The same can be done for different types of computer software.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is advisable to write down the definition of the computer, hardware, and software on the whiteboard. Please review each definition with students and repeat such definitions as you see fit. Repetition is key for this and all lessons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 2: What are the Different Types of Computers?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to identify different types of computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to identify a desktop computer and its main parts.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students will be able to identify a laptop and its main parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>This lesson can be presented using a lot of images. This will require the teacher to have cut outs of the different types of computers, a desktop computer and its main parts, and a laptop. If there is no time to make cut outs for all of these, it can be helpful to have the cut outs of the desktop computer and the laptop at a minimum.</p>
<p>It is also very helpful to have visual representations for each of these on the projector. The teacher can easily do this by making an image search of these topics in google.com and then present each visual on the projector as it is being presented.</p>
<p>At this stage, many students may not be ready to turn on the desktop computer in front of them. However, a helpful exercise is to form groups of two students and let them discuss the main parts of the computer among them. The goal is that each student tells the other the name of each of the main parts to the other and vice versa. This exercise will help them memorize the name of each of the main parts of the desktop computer.</p>
<p>When talking about the laptop and its main parts, it can be helpful for the teacher to bring an actual laptop to the classroom. Assuming that this laptop is not for personal use, it can be helpful to pass around the laptop to each student to view it closely.</p>
<p>Lastly, repeat the same exercise of letting students move around the computer mouse and place their hands on the keyboard. These small exercises will prep them for lesson 3, where each student will get to turn on and off a desktop computer and a laptop.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 3: What are the Different Types of Computer Buttons?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students should be able to recognize the different types of computer buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lesson 4: What are the Different Types of Computer Ports?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students should be able to recognize the different types of computer ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lesson 5: What are the Different Types of Computer Slots?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students should be able to recognize the different types of computer slots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>One of the main goals of lessons 3, 4, and 5 is for students to recognize the computer power button, the USB port, and the expansion card slot. It is advisable for the teacher to have cut outs for each of these. It is advisable to present each of these topics in one class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After presenting the different types of computer buttons, ports, and slots, the following two exercises can be very helpful to help students increase their comfort level with computers:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Group exercise to locate buttons, ports, and slots</li>
    <li>Turn on and turn off a desktop computer</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Group exercise to locate buttons, ports, and slots</h3>
<p>The goal of this group exercise is to have each group explore the various computer buttons, ports, and slots. Let them explore and talk to each other. You will notice each student has their unique way of describing a computer button, port, and slot. That is totally fine for now.</p>
<p>Walk around the classroom and approach each group. Point at a specific computer button, port or slot and have the group come up with the correct name. Do this a few times, especially for the power button, the USB port, and the expansion card slot. Make sure everyone in the group can locate and correctly name the computer button, port, or slot you are pointing at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turn on and turn off a desktop computer</h3>
<p>This exercise is optional, but it can really help students who only have access to a desktop computer in class to feel more comfortable with computers.</p>
<p>For this exercise, make sure all desktop computers in the classroom are turned off. Next, ask students to locate the power button on the computer&rsquo;s system unit. In addition, have each student show the location of the power button to the person next to them. Lastly, ask students to press the power button. As the computer boots up, notice the expression of the students. Enjoy this moment. They just learned how to turn on a desktop computer!</p>
<p>Assuming all computers in the classroom have Windows 10 installed and require a username and password to log in, have each student move and click the computer mouse. As they do this step, ask them if they see the power button anywhere on the screen. The power button should be located on the lower-right of the screen.</p>
<p>Once they locate the power button, let them try clicking on it. Explain to them the options that come up after pressing it. The typical options are sleep, shut down and restart. Let them try clicking on the shutdown option to turn off the computer. Some students may not be able to do so, and that is ok. Most students have never used a computer mouse, so please be patient. For those who managed to shut down the computer, have them help their peers who are still unable to do so. Observe the classroom and help the students that are struggling the most. Show them how to do it patiently.</p>
<p>Repeat these exercises a few times in this and future classes. These will help students increase their comfort level with computers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 6: What are the Different Types of Computer Peripherals?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students should be able to recognize the different types of computer peripherals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>It can really help to bring a few computer peripherals to class when you present this material to students. If this is not possible, show different computer peripherals on the projector. It can also help to classify each peripheral as an input, output, processing, or storage device. But it is not necessary.</p>
<p>Since most computer peripherals use a USB port, show them how to connect them to the desktop computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 7: What is the Correct Sitting Posture at a Desktop Computer?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Students should be able to explain the correct sitting posture at a desktop computer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>One of the best ways to present this material is to demonstrate the correct sitting posture in front of a desktop computer. Demonstrate each step as you describe it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Lesson 8: How to Turn On and Turn Off a Desktop Computer?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be able to describe the correct steps to turn on and turn off a desktop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this lesson:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be able to describe the correct steps to turn on and turn off a laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note to the teacher:&nbsp;</strong>It is advisable to present the material from these two lessons in one class. The following exercise will help students solidified the steps to correctly turn on and turn off a desktop computer. Do the same exercise for a laptop.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Turn on and turn off a desktop computer</h3>
<p>For this exercise, make sure all desktop computers in the classroom are turned off. Next, ask students to locate the power button on the computer&rsquo;s system unit.
