		<h4>The Different Types of Computer Peripherals</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.1.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A basic desktop computer setup usually includes the system unit, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but many different types of devices 
		can be plugged into the extra ports on the computer. These devices are called peripherals. Figure 31 shows some of the most common ones 
		[12].</p>
		
		<h4>Printer</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.2.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A printer is used to print documents, photos, and anything else that appears on your screen. There are many types of printers, 
		including inkjet, laser, and photo printers. There are also all-in-one printers, which can also scan and copy documents (see Figure 32) 
		[12]. </p>
		
		<h4>Scanner</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.3.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A scanner allows you to copy a physical image or document and save it to your computer as a digital image. Many scanners are included 
		as part of an all-in-one printer, but you can also buy a separate flatbed or handheld scanner (see Figure 33) [12]. </p>
		
		<h4>Speakers</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.4.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>Speakers are output devices, which means they send information from the computer to the userâ€”in this case, they allow you to hear 
		sound and music. Depending on the model, the speakers may connect to the audio port or the USB port. Some computer monitors also have 
		built-in speakers (see Figure 34) [12]. </p>
		
		<h4>Microphone</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.5.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A microphone is a type of input device, or a device that receives information from a user. You can connect a microphone to record 
		sound or talk with someone else over the Internet. Many laptops come with built-in microphones (see Figure 35) [12]. </p>
		
		<h4>Web Camera</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.6.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A web camera is a type of input device that can record videos and take pictures. It can also transmit video over the Internet in real 
		time, which allows for video chat or video conferencing with someone else. Many web cameras also include a microphone. (see Figure 36) 
		[12].</p>
		
		<h4>Digital Camera</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.7.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A digital camera lets you capture pictures and videos in a digital format. By connecting the camera to a computer's USB port, you can 
		transfer the images from the camera to the computer. (see Figure 37) [12]. </p>
		
		<h4>Smartphone</h4>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_6.8.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A smartphone is a cell phone that allows you to do more than make phone calls and send text messages. Smartphones can browse the 
		Internet and run software programs like a computer (see Figure 38) [35]. </p>
