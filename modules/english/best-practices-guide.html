<h1>Digital Literacy Skills Classroom Best Practices Guide</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the Centro de Formaci&oacute;n Integral LaSalle,</p>
<p>Thank you for volunteering your time to help us improve the lives of our student community. This brief guide provides you with some best practices that you can use in your digital literacy skills classroom. It is not an extensive guide, and we understand that all our teachers have a unique teaching style. Please use this advice as you see fit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Class Preparation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Many of our students do not have computers at home, preventing them from reviewing any classroom material online.<ul>
            <li>One way to mitigate this problem is to provide any material discussed in class available at the front desk for students to print and take home.</li>
            <li>
                <p>If you decide to use the digital literacy skills content provided to you by the center director, let students know which lessons are relevant for your class, so they can request a print version of that lesson. Please note that the available digital literacy content is also available online for students to review in their phones.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Many students are visual learners. It is advisable to prepare cut outs of the main concepts presented in each class. These visual aids can help students remember the exact computer terminology seen in class.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You can request the front desk to print these cut outs for you.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Class Organization</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For the center to help as many students as possible each semester, there may be times where your student group may vary in skills, age, and abilities. You will likely observe this after your first or second class. One way you can organize your classroom is to pair up a fast learner student with a student who is struggling a little bit more. This will increase student collaboration and provide you with some time to individually help students who are struggling the most.</li>
    <li>
        <p>Use the whiteboard to write down the most important concepts you want students to learn from each class. Please try to make your writing a little bit bigger so that all students are able read the whiteboard You can request the front desk to print these cut outs for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Please also provide any material that you write on the whiteboard available for students to print at the front desk so that they can review it at home.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Make use of the projector to show students images of any concept you are presenting in each class. This can help students visualize the most complex concepts (i.e., CPU, motherboard, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Teacher&apos;s Golden Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Listen to the student. Before you start your first class, it is helpful to have students share a little bit about themselves. Here are some starter questions:&nbsp;<ul>
            <li>What is your name?</li>
            <li>
                <p>Why are you taking this class?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Can you share something you like doing outside the classroom?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Repetition is key. Because your student group may vary in skills, age, and abilities, it is essential that you do not get bothered when students ask you to repeat a concept that you just presented.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This is a skill that many teachers to do not have the patience for, and it can really hurt the classroom dynamics if you seem bothered repeating a concept. Please be conscious of this and repeat the concept in different ways as you see fit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In fact, it is advisable that you make repetition a ground rule in your classroom. In other words, inform students to expect a lot of repetition for complex concepts in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is also advisable to encourage students to take notes of the complex concepts in their own notebook.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Collaboration among students in essential. Before you start your first class, please set the tone for your classroom. What this means is to inform students that your classroom depends on everyone helping each other out. This also means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No student should be on Facebook.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>No student should be on WhatsApp.</li>
            <li>No student should be working alone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Set specific rules for students who need to take phone calls during class.<ul>
            <li>It is advisable to inform students to please set their phones to vibrate and take their call outside the classroom if needed.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
