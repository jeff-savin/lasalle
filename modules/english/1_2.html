		<h3>The Different Types of Computers</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.1.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>There are many types of computers. But when most people hear the word computer, they think of a desktop computer or laptop. However, 
		computers can come in many shapes and sizes, perform various operations, and serve different functions. Examples of computers include 
		tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, game consoles, TVs, servers and more (see Figure 3) [1].</p>
				
		<h3>A Desktop Computer and its Main Parts</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.2.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A desktop computer (see Figure 4) is a personal computing device designed to fit on top of a typical office desk due to its size and 
		power requirements. Its main parts consist of a system unit, a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse [1, 3].</p>
		
		<h3>The System Unit</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.3.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The computer system unit (see Figure 5) is a boxlike case that contains the main components of the computer, including the motherboard, 
		central processing unit (CPU), power supply, hard disk drive, and optical disc drive [4, 5]. Other names for the system unit include the 
		computer chassis, cabinet, box, tower, or simply case. Most people erroneously refer to the system unit as the CPU.</p>
		
		<h3>The Computer Monitor</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.4.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The computer monitor (see Figure 6) also known as screen is an output device which displays information in pictorial form (images and 
		text). It comprises circuitry, a screen, a power supply, buttons to adjust screen settings, and casing that holds all these components 
		[6, 7].</p>
		
		<h3>The Computer Keyboard</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.5.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The computer keyboard (see Figure 7) is an input device that is used to enter characters (e.g. letters, numbers and other symbols) 
		into a computer system by pressing buttons or keys [5, 8]. There are different types of keyboards (e.g., wired, wireless, mechanical, 
		membrane, QWERTY, DVORAK, etc.), but most are very similar and allow you to achieve the same basic tasks [9].</p>
		
		<h3>The Computer Mouse</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.6.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The computer mouse (see Figure 8) is an input device that controls a cursor on the computer screen to interact with files, folders, 
		windows, and other software elements [10]. There are two main mouse types: optical and mechanical [5].</p>
		
		<h3>A Laptop and its Main Parts</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.7.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A laptop is a battery-powered computer that is portable and nearly as powerful as a desktop computer [1]. Despite looking very 
		different, the laptop and the desktop computer use the same programs and perform similar tasks (see Figure 9) [11].</p>
		
		<h3>The Webcam</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.8.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>A webcam is a type of input device that can record videos and take pictures. It can also transmit video over the Internet in real 
		time, which allows for video chat or video conferencing with someone else [12]. Laptops have a webcam above its screen (see Figure 10) 
		[13].</p>
		
		<h3>The Display (or Screen)</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.9.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The display (or screen), like a desktop monitor, is an output device which displays information in pictorial form (images and text). 
		It is built into the laptop’s lid (see Figure 11) [14].</p>
		
		<h3>The Keyboard</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.10.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The keyboard is an input device that is used to enter characters (e.g., letters, numbers, and other symbols) into a laptop by pressing 
		buttons or keys [5]. It is located beneath the laptop’s display, and unlike they keyboard on desktop computers, most laptop keyboards do 
		not have a numeric keypad (see figure 12) [15].</p>
		
		<h3>The Touchpad</h3>
				
		<p><img src="https://jeff-savin.github.io/lasalle/images/1_2.11.PNG" alt="Alt text" class="center"/></p>
				
		<p>The touchpad also called a trackpad is an input device that does the same thigs as a computer mouse [16]. It is a touch-sensitive pad 
		that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger (see figure 13) [17].</p>
