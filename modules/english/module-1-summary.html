		<h2>Module 1: Summary</h2>
	
		<p>In this module, we have learned what a computer is: a device to process, store and retrieve information. All computers are composed of both hardware and software.  The physical parts of the computer are called the hardware, and include the keyboard, monitor, mouse and system unit.  Computer software refers to the code inside the computer that tells the computer what to do.</p>
		<p>We also learned to identify the hardware components of a computer.  You see this summary now on the computer monitor, and navigate on the page with the help of the mouse and keyboard.  A laptop has similar, but slightly different looking hardware, using a built-in keyboard and touchpad.  We also learned common computer buttons, ports, and their operation.  You can insert preloaded programs into the computer using the optical disk drive.  Finally, we learned the basics of starting up and shutting down the computer.</p>
