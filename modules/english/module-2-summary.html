		<h2>Summary</h2>
				
		<p>In this module, we have learned more about the computer mouse, and its various components.  The mouse consists of the body and three main inputs: the left click and right click buttons, and the scroll wheel. The movement of your mouse is tracked on the computer monitor and displayed through an icon called the pointer.  </p>
    <p>We have learned that there are two main types of computer mice: wired and wireless.  Wired mice are connected to the computer through an attached wire, while wireless mice are connected through a receiver.  Both are attached to the computer via the USB port.  Finally, we learned the basics of how to use the mouse, the actions of the mouse clicks, and the meaning of various types of pointers.</p>
