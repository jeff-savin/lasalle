		<h3>Mouse Pointers</h3>
								
		<p>Using your hand to move the mouse will also move the graphic <b></b>pointer</b> (also sometimes called 
			the cursor) on the computer screen. The pointer has a variety of different shapes that indicate its 
			current behavior.</p>

		<p>The following table describes some of the most common pointer shapes and their meaning.</p>

		<h3>Mouse Clicks</h3>
		
		<p>One of the major ways to use the mouse is through <b>clicking.</b> When you click, you interact with 
			the computer and tell it what you want it to do.  In order to click, take your hand and hold the mouse.  
			Then, with your index finger, press and release the <b>left mouse button</b>.  This will select an object on the 
			computer screen that you want to interact with.  In most contexts, clicking the <b>right mouse button</b> will 
			open a menu with options. To perform a <b>double click</b>, quickly click the left mouse button two times. 
			This action is used to open folders, files, or to start a program on your computer. You can also perform a 
		    <b>drag</b> and <b>drop</b> to move icons, folders or files around.  To do this, click on a file, 
			folder or icon, and hold the click down.  Then, drag the object where you would like to place it.</p>
