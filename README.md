## Centro de Formación Integral LaSalle, A.C. de Tijuana, B.C.

### Partner Organization
The Centro de Formación Integral LaSalle, A.C. de Tijuana, B. C. It is a volunteer-run, community school that offers free social and educational programs to low-income communities.

### Partner organization’s needs and challenges
The school is currently unable to provide sufficient digital literacy skills classes to all students, due to the lack of digital literacy volunteer teachers and the lack of digital literacy materials.  There is also no teacher training program for the volunteers, who don’t have relevant experience. As a result, many students are unable to enroll in digital literacy classes and are placed on a long wait list. 

### Specific needs the C4G team will address
The team will provide a bilingual (English/Spanish) digital literacy skills class and teacher training program. This will consist of a six-module digital literacy course, a self-guided manual on how to use the digital literacy course in the classroom, and a best practices guide on how to run a digital literacy skills class. This training program will have off-line and web-based options. 

### What the solution would look like to the intended users?
Both students and teachers at the center will have access to the web-based solution, which will consist of a six-module digital literacy course. Each module will have its own card along with different sections. The sections represent the actual topics of the module.  

In terms of functionality, the website may be adapted to work on any screen size. This avoids the need to create a separate mobile application. In addition, the website will have a teacher section where anyone interested in teaching a digital literacy course at the center will get access to the self-guided manual and the best practices guide. Lastly, the teacher training program will have an off-line version. This off-line version will consist of PDF files for the digital literacy course, self-guided manual, and best practices guide. 

### Feedback from partner organization and other stakeholders
We plan to elicit feedback from Jorge, the center’s director, and from Shivam at our weekly meetings. In addition, one volunteer teacher has expressed interest in providing suggestions and feedback on our project. We plan to gather the teacher’s feedback on a weekly basis via zoom or via a survey. All feedback will be discussed amongst the team and will be integrated based on the level of difficulty and time required. As the project evolves, we will continue to gather feedback from Jorge, Shivam, and current volunteer teachers via discussions and surveys. 

### Plan for development, evaluation, and deployment 
The C4G team formulated the project in five main phases: research, recruitment, content creation, teacher preparation, and web portal creation and deployment. We will first research several example classes for digital literacy courses and teacher training, incorporating the best ideas for the center. In the recruitment phase, we will identify teachers interested in taking the training program.  We will then develop several course modules for teaching digital literacy.  Our current plan includes a multi-module course covering, for example, introductions to the computer, internet and email.  We will then work with the recruited volunteers to develop teaching guides and best practices.  Finally, the modules will be published online.

### Design and development choices
One development choice that we have made at this stage is the use of GitHub Pages to fulfill the needs for our website while providing more flexibility versus alternative options such as Wordpress.  Regarding the design of the website, we are inspired by the design of Northstar Digital Literacy, a digital literacy program created by Literacy Minnesota.  We anticipate using elements of the Northstar designs in our website.
